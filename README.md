## 📂 Dataset
The dataset comprises 1,000 images from the [FlickrUser](https://github.com/fiabdu/Commonly-Interesting-Images) dataset for single-image interestingness assessment and 2,500 image pairs for relative interestingness assessment.

📦 Download dataset: [Link]()

The download includes the following files:

- _Images_Metadata.csv_ – contains metadata for each image, including scores from other approaches (e.g., CI score, aesthetic score, etc.).
- _Single_Interestingness.csv_ – contains interestingness responses for individual images.
- _Relative_Interestingness.csv_ – contains interestingness responses for image pairs.

The interestingness files include ground-truth human labels and responses generated by Large Multimodal Models, including **GPT-4o**, **Llama-3.2**, and **DeepSeek-VL2**.

Additionally, the provided Jupyter Notebook Playground.ipynb can be used to load, explore, and save data in Python.

## 🛠️ Set up for Playground.ipynb
```
conda create -n envInt python=3.10
conda activate envInt
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
